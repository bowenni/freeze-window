     * Called whenever {@link hudson.model.Queue} is considering if {@link hudson.model.Queue.Item} is ready to execute immediately
     * (which doesn't necessarily mean that it gets executed right away &mdash; it's still subject to
     * executor availability), or if it should be considered blocked.
     * <p/>
     * <p/>
     * Compared to {@link #canTake(hudson.model.Node, hudson.model.Queue.BuildableItem)}, this version tells Jenkins that the task is
     * simply not ready to execute, even if there's available executor. This is more efficient
     * than {@link #canTake(hudson.model.Node, hudson.model.Queue.BuildableItem)}, and it sends the right signal to Jenkins so that
     * it won't use {@link hudson.slaves.Cloud} to try to provision new executors.
     * <p/>
     * <p/>
     * Vetos are additive. When multiple {@link hudson.model.queue.QueueTaskDispatcher}s are in the system,
     * the task is considered blocked if any one of them returns a non-null value.
     * (This relationship is also the same with built-in check logic.)
     * <p/>
     * <p/>
     * If a {@link hudson.model.queue.QueueTaskDispatcher} returns non-null from this method, the task is placed into
     * the 'blocked' state, and generally speaking it stays in this state for a few seconds before
     * its state gets re-evaluated. If a {@link hudson.model.queue.QueueTaskDispatcher} wants the blockage condition
     * to be re-evaluated earlier, call {@link hudson.model.Queue#scheduleMaintenance()} to initiate that process.
     *
     * @return null to indicate that the item is ready to proceed to the buildable state as far as this
     *         {@link hudson.model.queue.QueueTaskDispatcher} is concerned. Otherwise return an object that indicates why
     *         the build is blocked.
